	<p><b>As a student in Computing my personal traits play a significant role in shaping 			how I approach my academic life and professional development.

	<p>I consider myself a caring individual, and this has positively influenced my ability to 		collaborate effectively in group projects. Whether working on system designs, 				cybersecurity policies, or database assignments, I naturally support my teammates and 			contribute to creating a productive and respectful working environment.</p>

	<p>Being jovial allows me to maintain a positive attitude, even during stressful periods such 		as exams or tight project deadlines. This helps me manage pressure effectively and keeps 		me motivated throughout the semester. It also makes me approachable, which strengthens 			communication with both peers and lecturers.</p>

	<p>My innovative mindset drives me to think beyond standard solutions. I enjoy developing 		creative approaches to technical problems, whether it involves designing software systems, 		troubleshooting code, or proposing structured governance frameworks. I constantly look for 		ways to improve efficiency and effectiveness in my work.</p>

	<p>I am also highly determined. When faced with challenging concepts or complex debugging 		tasks, I persist until I fully understand and resolve the issue. This resilience has 			strengthened my technical foundation and allowed me to continuously grow academically.</p>

	<p>Being open-minded enables me to accept constructive criticism and learn from different 		perspectives. In areas such as organizational behaviour, cybersecurity ethics, and system 		governance, this trait allows me to evaluate problems critically and adapt accordingly.<p>

	<p>Finally, my technical aptitude gives me confidence in practical and analytical tasks. I am 		comfortable working with code, systems, and data structures, and I actively seek 			opportunities to strengthen my problem-solving skills.</p>

	<p>Overall, these traits collectively shape me into a disciplined, collaborative, and 			forward-thinking student who is committed to academic excellence and continuous 			improvement.</b></p>

	<h3> Favorite quote</h3>
	<p><i>You choose to live your life relative to which reference point you choose positive or negative. ~ Dr. Gregory Haughton</I></p>
		

	<h3> Background on Dr. Gregory Haughton</h3>
	<p>Dr. Gregory Haughton is a Jamaican three time olympic medalist, leadership strategist and mentor. He grew up poor in a community called Seaview gardens and attended the Excelsior High School. Later he migrated and now is a very successful man. I've met Dr. Haughton on numerous occasions and he always shares his perspective on life to me. Giving me tips, motivational speeches and words of encouragement. He would fit the description of my hero. </p>


	<h3> Report on AI Businesses of 2025(AI-powered healthcare diagnostics)</h3>
<p>My favorite idea among the others is the  AI-powered healthcare diagnostics. I chose this idea because healthcare today is mostly operated in such a way that patients seek help only after symptoms appear or worsen. However, modern healthcare systems are shifting toward a proactive approach that focuses on prevention and early detection. AI plays a key role in making this possible.

AI-powered diagnostic apps analyze wearable data, medical images, lab results, and patient history to detect diseases earlier and more accurately effectively than ever. These systems can monitor heart rate, blood sugar, sleep patterns, and other health indicators in real time, recognizing abnormalities before they become serious or life threatening. AI can also read scans such as MRIs and X-rays to improve diagnostic accuracy.

In the world or  in Jamaica and the Caribbean this technology could greatly improve healthcare accessibility. With limited numbers specialists and overcrowded hospitals, AI tools could help monitor patients with health risks remotely,  which can reduce unnecessary hospital visits, and detect chronic illnesses like diabetes and hypertension earlier. This would save costs and improve quality of life, especially for the older population.

With this great idea there are risks which include data privacy risks, algorithmic bias, accountability for incorrect diagnoses, and over-reliance on the tool. To manage these issues, strong encryption, strict data protection policies, diverse training datasets, and human oversight must be implemented. This AI should support doctors, not replace them. An example of such and app exists and the link is pasted below</p>

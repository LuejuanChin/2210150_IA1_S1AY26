		<h1>Summary on Pillars by Jim Rohn</h1>
        	
    		<h3>Chapter 4 – Achieve Your Goals</h3>

<p>This chapter focuses on the importance of setting written goals and shows us that  success is not accidental or comes by luck, it starts when you defines what you want. Goals give direction and purpose, helping individuals measure progress and stay motivated. The chapter stresses writing goals down, reviewing them regularly, and breaking them into actionable steps. What I took away from this chapter was that ambition without structure leads nowhere. Writing down goals transforms dreams into commitments. As a student and aspiring professional, having clearly defined goals helps me stay focused and disciplined which will enable me to achieve my goals.

		<h3>Chapter 5 – The Proper Use of Time</h3>

This chapter focuses on the fact that time is valuable. Everyone has the same 24 hours, but all comes down to how it is spent The chapter highlights prioritization, discipline, and eliminating distractions as a pathway to success. Successful people do not waste time, they use it wisely. This chapter made me reflect on how I manage my daily schedule. Procrastination and distractions can slow my progress. Being intentional and focused with time, especially on my  assignments and responsibilities, is very important

	<h3>Chapter 6 – Surround Yourself with the Best People</h3>

Jim Rohn states that we become the average of the five people we spend the most time with. This chapter focuses on choosing positive, motivated, and growth-oriented individuals as part of your inner circle. The people around us influence our mindset, standards, and habits.This chapter supports the idea that environment shapes behavior. Surrounding myself with focused individuals pushes me to elevate my own standards, and follows the popular Jamaican saying 'Choose your friends wisely"
<h3>Chapter 7 – Be a Lifelong Learner</h3>

This chapter focuses on continuous self-education. Formal education may provide a living, but self-education builds a fortune. Reading, listening to mentors, and constantly improving skills are important for personal and professional growth.This chapter strongly resonates with me as a Computer Science student. Technology evolves rapidly, and staying relevant requires constant learning and adaptability and innovation.

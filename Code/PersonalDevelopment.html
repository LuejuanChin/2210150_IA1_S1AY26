		<h1>Summary on Pillars by Jim Rohn</h1>
        	
    		<h3>Chapter 4 – Achieve Your Goals</h3>

<p>This chapter emphasizes the importance of setting clear, written goals. Jim Rohn teaches that success is not accidental; it is intentional and begins with defining what you truly want. Goals give direction and purpose, helping individuals measure progress and stay motivated. The chapter stresses writing goals down, reviewing them regularly, and breaking them into actionable steps. What I took away from this chapter was that ambition without structure leads nowhere. Writing down goals transforms dreams into commitments. As a student and aspiring professional, having clearly defined academic and career goals helps me stay focused and disciplined.

		<h3>Chapter 5 – The Proper Use of Time</h3>

Time is presented as one of the most valuable resources. Everyone has the same 24 hours, but the difference lies in how effectively it is used. The chapter highlights prioritization, discipline, and eliminating distractions as keys to productivity. Successful people do not waste time—they invest it wisely.

Reflection:
This chapter made me reflect on how I manage my daily schedule. Procrastination and distractions can delay progress. Being intentional with time, especially as a student balancing assignments and responsibilities, is critical for long-term success.

	<h3>Chapter 6 – Surround Yourself with the Best People</h3>

Jim Rohn famously states that we become the average of the five people we spend the most time with. This chapter emphasizes choosing positive, motivated, and growth-oriented individuals as part of one’s inner circle. The people around us influence our mindset, standards, and habits.

Reflection:
This chapter reinforces the idea that environment shapes behavior. Surrounding myself with focused classmates, mentors, and ambitious individuals pushes me to elevate my own standards. It also reminds me to contribute positively to others’ growth.

<h3>Chapter 7 – Be a Lifelong Learner</h3>

This chapter focuses on continuous self-education. Formal education may provide a living, but self-education builds a fortune. Reading, listening to mentors, and constantly improving skills are emphasized as keys to personal and professional growth.

Reflection:
This chapter strongly resonates with me as a Computer Science student. Technology evolves rapidly, and staying relevant requires constant learning. Lifelong learning ensures adaptability, innovation, and long-term success.
